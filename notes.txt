Location button not showing up on top of circle but instead being positioned in the same place
How to make the location button show up on top of the circle?

For each location we have a div and this div contains a circle and a location button

Translating the location button moved its position
All location buttons share the same location. This is not correct. They should all have unique locations, the same as the red circles. Should they be children of the circles then?
Note: when the parent fades, so does the child

If the button and circle were siblings of the same parent, a location-item div, then the location-item div would need to be scattered about the page and not the circle
